shortBio: 'Platforms, Digital Transformation, Sociotechnical Systems Design, and API Governance. Proud Dakotan, #AFOL, & Writer of the Net API Notes newsletter.'
---
I like software platforms, digital transformation, architecture, people management, and writing. I've built and maintained software governance teams at multiple Fortune 500 companies. I love building successful, sustainable software development cultures.

In other words, as [Tobbe Gyllebring says](https://twitter.com/drunkcod/status/1386437436524302336), "I'm just a set of half-century old memes in a trench coat pretending to be a thought leader."

I write about the transformative nature of the API industry in my weekly email newsletter, [Net API Notes](https://tinyletter.com/NetAPINotes/archive). Because all the cool names make business folk furrow their brows, my website is [just my name](https://matthewreinbold.com).
